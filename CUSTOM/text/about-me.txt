is a knitwear and textile design studio based in Amsterdam. All designs are handmade and out of deadstock material from the Netherlands. Most of the inspiration for shape, color, and material derives from nature and environmental conflicts, declaring the designs are not only inspired by the purity of nature but also by its disarray and morbidity, providing food for thoughts for a more curated and conscious way of craft.
