single /double bed size 4, 2x linen yarn, 1x silk 
The dress is crafted using two linen yarns and one silk yarn, knitted on a single bed with a size 4 stitch. It undergoes a dyeing process using gall apple and iron, along with red onion skins. The over panel is created using an open rotative double bed knit technique, and the edges are dipped in alginate, serving as a finishing touch. In the back part of the dress, the biomaterial acts as a bio glue, combining two different knit panels. This coating functions similarly to how mycelium connects different tree species in nature.
