double bed rib 2x1 size 4
This look represents strength and simplicity. It features a dress created from a single piece of knitted fabric, which is then coated on the top part. The alginate coating molds the garment to the body size, creating a contrast with the soft underlay. The back of the dress is open and secured with three hooks at the back and on the right shoulder. The coating is naturally dyed using oak apple and iron sulfate, with an alginate base, and is applied on a mannequin.
