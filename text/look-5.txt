double bed rib 2x1 size 4
The pullover is made out of different organic shaped panels on a double bed knitting machine, 
They alongate around the body and are a tense 2x1 rib. Some of the edges which ripped are glued with biomaterial coating. The shorts should represent a vegan leather alternative. The knitted fabric is fully coated with agar agar and naturally dyed in oak apple and iron sulfete. It gives a leather like stiffness to it and is cut after knitting and sewn together. Look 5 belongs to the stronger looks as the densitiy is inncreased to the fullest and the biomaterial gives a protective coating on top.
