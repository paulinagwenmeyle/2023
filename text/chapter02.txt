THE JOURNEY
<br>
<br>
<br>
The dress is entirely made on a single-bed knitting machine using linen yarn. Needles are hand-manipulated to create a horizontal stitch inspired by mountain lines. 
The cuffs and collar of the dress are coated with agar-based biomaterial and naturally dyed with avocado skin.
