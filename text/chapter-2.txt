Chapter 2, “The Promising Journey,” presents distant mountain ranges piling up on the horizon. The sun casts orange reflections into the sky, while architectural facades and structured materials serve as guiding elements along the path.

The dress is entirely knitted using linen yarn, with the needles being hand-manipulated to create a horizontal stitch inspired by mountain lines. The cuffs and collar of the dress are coated with naturally dyed avocado skin agar, matching the dye used for the entire dress.
