THE DROUGHT
<br>
<br>
<br>
The textile project "Seeking" tells a transformative journey from drought to oasis, expressed through three captivating chapters with new materials and textures.
Chapter 1, "The Drought," portrays the escalating temperature rise's impact on soil and natural life. Irregular and broken structures in the textile collection mirror the ground's cracking.

The overpanel is made from kombucha leather dyed in red wine, layered with an agar sheet dyed with red onion skins.
