Developed from material experimentation the full-knit collection deals with the opposition to socially constructed gender norms.
The crochet is fully recycled either made out of old newspaper or raffia. All yarns are hand dyed in a natural dye bath of beetroot, blueberry, and iron. The paper crochet is created by using old newspaper articles from the “ZEIT” newspaper and combined with hand-knit pieces through an elongated hand-stitch, creating a symbiotic connection between the two.
