The collection "High Grounds" aims to inspire reevaluation and foster connectivity among individuals, drawing inspiration from nature, which serves as our ultimate source of knowledge and inspiration. Climate change poses a formidable global challenge, and our inability to address it can be attributed to our narrow focus solely on individual needs. To surmount this crisis, we must recognize the imperative of sustainable and collaborative efforts. Nature's example, particularly for this collection the “wood wide web”, where trees and fungi connect through mycelium, provides guidance for community building and effective problem-solving.
In this knitwear collection, a harmonious blend of machine knitting and hand knitting with biomaterial coatings symbolizes a transformation from fragility to empowerment. It encourages contemplation of individual vulnerability while advocating for thoughtful design and craftsmanship. The aesthetic embraces organic shapes, serene earth tones, and cellulose fibers like cotton and linen. Layers and romantic silhouettes highlight the importance of considerate consumption and the use of natural materials.
