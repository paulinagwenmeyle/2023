Chapter 3, “The Oasis,” represents a place we aspire to explore and enjoy all its facilities. It is a space where abstraction takes form, where the fragile nature intertwines with humanity to sustain a strong life cycle.

The top is crafted from linen on a single bed knitting machine and coated with agar. The alginate coating binds together when the ingredients are mixed, activated by the heat of movement. Glycerin is added to provide flexibility to the coating, while alginate powder thickens it. Sunflower oil can be incorporated to minimize material shrinkage during the drying process. To introduce color, a natural dye bath can replace water. To dry the coating, a solution of calcium chloride and hot water is sprayed onto the fabric. This drying procedure is repeated twice daily over the course of a week to ensure the coating is fully dried and secure.
