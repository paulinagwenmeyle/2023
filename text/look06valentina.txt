The look exudes strength and simplicity with a dress made from a single piece of knitted fabric. The top part is coated with alginate, shaping the garment to the body and creating a captivating contrast with the soft underlay. The back of the dress is alluringly open and fastened with three hooks at the back and on the right shoulder. The coating is naturally dyed using oak apple and iron sulfate with an alginate base, meticulously applied on a mannequin for its enchanting form.
