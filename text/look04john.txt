The dress is made from two linen yarns and one silk yarn, achieving its unique color, through a dyeing process involving gall apple, iron, and red onion skins. The over panel is created using an open rotative double bed knit technique, with the edges dipped in alginate for a new finish.
The back part of the dress incorporates biomaterial as “a bio glue”, ingeniously combining two different knit panels.
