Paulina Gwen Meyle is a knitwear and textile designer based in Amsterdam. All designs are handmade using deadstock materials from the Netherlands. The studio draws inspiration from nature and environmental conflicts, incorporating shapes, colors, and materials that reflect both the purity and disarray of nature. This approach stimulates contemplation and encourages a more curated and conscious approach to craftsmanship.
