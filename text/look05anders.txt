The pullover features organic-shaped panels made on a double bed knitting machine, elongating gracefully around the body in a 2x1 rib. Biomaterial coating mends any ripped edges. The shorts offer a vegan leather alternative, with knitted fabric coated in agar and naturally dyed in oak apple and iron sulfate, giving it a leather-like stiffness.
