single bed leather stitch, size 4
Look 2 introduces the knitting machine and a single bed. The linen yarn is manipulated with the needle to shape the stitches in an organic manner. The material is coated with a biomaterial derived from orange peel and algae. The coating mixture consists of 14g of glycerin, 24g of alginate, 5g of finely ground orange peel, and 400ml of water. Through the coating process, the material can be manipulated, allowing for cutting without destroying it, resulting in a snake skin- like texture and appearance. The bra underneath is fully fashioned using the partially knitting technique to create a more organic structure.
