is an Amsterdam-based knitwear and textile designer who graduated in 2022 from the Amsterdam Fashion Institute with a degree in fashion design & technology. Inspired by environmental conflicts, her creations reflect both the purity and disarray of nature. Her designs are handcrafted using deadstock materials sourced from the Netherlands and handmade on a domestic knitting machine. With this tool, she achieves intricate patterns that can be tailored and custom-made, emphasizing a conscious and deliberate approach to craftsmanship.
