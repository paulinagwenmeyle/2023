Chapter 1, “The Drought,” focuses on the increasing rise in 
temperature each year and its impact on the soil and natural life cycle.

The overpanel is crafted from kombucha leather, dyed in red wine, and sewn after drying. 
It is layered with an agar sheet dyed with red onion skins. The dress is created using a 
single bed knitting machine and manipulated with alginate, enhancing the resilience and durability 
of the delicate yarn, allowing for cutting into the knitted fabric if desired. It is naturally dyed 
in a bath of red onion skins. The top portion of the dress is made from linen on a single 
bed knitting machine and coated with agar.
